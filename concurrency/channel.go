// Worker pool pattern for processing jobs efficiently.
// Buffered vs. Unbuffered Channels â€“ know when to use which.
// Key concept: Avoid goroutine leaks by properly closing channels.

//Some important notes:
//buffered channel as example make(chan int, 5)
//Storage: Holds up to 5 values temporarily
//Order: FIFO (First-In-First-Out)
//Concurrency: Safe for goroutines, blocks when full/empty
//Blocking Behavior: Sender blocks when full, receiver blocks when empty
